## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load_data, echo=FALSE}
#loading resq dataset
resq_data <- read_excel("resq-raw-data/sample_hospital.xlsx")

#checking what rows that include NA values
resq_data %>%
  summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)))) %>%
  pivot_longer(everything()) %>%
  filter(value > 0)

#replacing NA's with zero's
resq_data %<>%
  replace(is.na(.), 99)


#creating tribbles for each variable/legend
